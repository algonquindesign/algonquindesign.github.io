# Algonquin Design + GitHub

The Algonquin College Graphic Design program believes in the power of open source—especially in education. We strive to make all of our code, tutorials, videos, & documentation open to everybody.

We use GitHub extensively in class. All student websites are hosted on GitHub Pages, they use GitHub for collaboration, host their [Grad Show](http://algonquindesign.ca/grads/) websites on GitHub & all of the code demonstrations, samples, etc. from class are available on GitHub. *(Can we say GitHub any more?)*
